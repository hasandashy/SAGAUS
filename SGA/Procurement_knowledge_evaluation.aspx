							<p class="title28">What is it?</p>
							<p>This is an evaluation of your Procurement knowledge. You will be guided through eight dimensions of Procurement and you will be asked nine multiple choice questions for each dimension. This is a timed assessment and at 60 minutes the assessment will close. </p>
							<p class="mrg-bt-10 txt-orange dark">The eight dimensions are:</p>
							<div class="floatL wide50-1">
								<ul class="tick-mark2">
									<li>Opportunity Analysis</li>
									<li>Market Analysis</li>
									<li>Strategy Development</li>
									<li>Market Engagement</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
							<div class="floatL wide50-1">
								<ul class="tick-mark2">
									<li>Negotiation</li>
									<li>Contract Implementation</li>
									<li>Supplier Relationship Management</li>
									<li>Strategy Refresh</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
							<div class="clear"></div>
							<p></p>
							<p>The question set is based on technical skills standards and there are varying levels of difficulty in the question set however, they are not designed to 'trip up' or trick you but rather to provide an insight into your expertise across procurement.</p>
							<p></p>
							<p class="title28">What is it used for?</p>
							<p>The South Australian Government is committed to maximising the value derived from the procurement process. The aim of this assessment process is to provide a snapshot of the current level of procurement and contract management capability across the SA Government. </p>
							<p></p>
							<p>A group report will be prepared that summarises procurement capability and capacity across the public sector along with some analysis and options for improvement.</p>
							<p></p>
							<p class="title28">Your individual feedback report</p>
							<p>This report is tailored especially for you and in it you will find suggestions and recommendations that will help you develop skills and knowledge in the areas identified for you.</p>
							<p></p>
							<p>Your report will be delivered after the conclusion of the assessment period. To receive your report you need to complete all assessments assigned to you.  </p>
							<p></p>
							<p><strong>REVIEW</strong> the 70:20:10 recommendations in your report, consider your development priorities and consider how you can apply the suggestions in your workplace. </p>

                            <p>As you work through the assessment you may find themes that are not directly relevant to your current role.</p>
                            <p></p>
                            <p>This is likely to happen for many people as this diagnostic considers a broad range of procurement capabilities.</p>
                            <p></p>
                            <p>It has purposefully been designed not to be role specific, instead it seeks to understand the South Australian Government procurement capability as a whole.</p>

                            <p class="title28">Remember!</p>
                            <p>This is a timed assessment and at 60 minutes the assessment will close.</p>

							<p class="title28 color-cmc">What is the evaluation about?</p>
							<p>This evaluation centres on the skills required to perform the procurement function in strategic procurement. It focusses on the eight-step procurement process and for each step asks you for nine knowledge based questions.</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<p>The question set is based on technical skills standards and the content of each question has been considered by procurement consultants and practitioners in Australia and U.K. to ensure relevance, reliability and validity of the question set.</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<p>There are varying levels of difficulty in the question set however, criteria are not designed to 'trip up' or trick you but rather to provide an insight into your expertise across the eight category management steps.</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<p class="mrg-bt-10 color-cmc dark">The 8 steps are:</p>
							<div class="floatL wide50-1">
								<ul class="tick-mark3">
									<li>Opportunity Analysis</li>
									<li>Market Analysis</li>
									<li>Strategy Development</li>
									<li>Market Engagement</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
							<div class="floatL wide50-1">
								<ul class="tick-mark3">
									<li>Negotiation</li>
									<li>Contract Implementation</li>
									<li>Supplier Relationship Management</li>
									<li>Strategy Refresh</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
							<div class="clear"></div>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<p>On completion you will receive an individual report with an assessment of your capability across a range of technical competencies. It will highlight each phase of the category management process focussing on both your strengths and your evolving skill-sets. The key output is a set of recommendations for both you and your manager to consider in order to optimise department and individual performance.</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<p class="title28 color-cmc">What's in it for me?</p>
							<ol class="list2">
								<li>Gain insight into your expertise in each step of the process.</li>
								<li>Benchmark your knowledge against the rest of the profession.</li>
								<li>Personalise your training plan with a move away from the 'sheep dip' approach.</li>
								<li>Receive an individualised report which you can use for your own personal development.</li>
								<li>A feeling of contribution!  The more respondents, the greater the benchmark measure across the region.</li>
							</ol>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<p class="title28 color-cmc">How long does it take?</p>
							<p>The evaluation generally takes around 30-40 minutes to complete. You will be taken to an Instructions page, then a general information page where we will ask a few questions about you and your procurement department. Then the evaluation begins - from this page until the end you will note a clock at the top of the page that countdowns your time as you progress through the evaluation.</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<p class="title28 color-cmc">Where does the information go?</p>
							<p>On completion of the evaluation you will receive a PDF report of your own results. We do not share these results with anyone in the industry without your prior permission to do so. The aggregate data from the evaluation provides a baseline for the tool to compare future test results for both individuals and for the aggregated organizational results.</p>

								<p class="mrg-bt-5">Here we will look to discover correlations between expertise in each stage of the process and other independent variables such as:</p>
								<p>&bull; Years of experience</p>
								<p>&bull; Qualifications</p>
								<p>&bull; Type of category</p>
								<p class="mrg-bt-5">experience, etc.</p>
								<p>Once we have reached 'critical mass' of respondents we will release to YOU an aggregate group report in the form of an 'industry white paper'.</p>

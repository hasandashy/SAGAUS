            <p class="pad-lt-rt-30">The project covers staff managing, undertaking and supporting procurement and/or contract management, either on a full-time basis or as the major proportion of their role (i.e. greater than 50%). Some agencies will have significant contracts managed outside the central unit by individuals or teams where contract management is their principal function and major focus on a day-to-day basis. Some agencies will also have de-centralised operations where individuals in those outlying units have procurement or contract management as a major proportion of their role. Community Services Procurement is included in the scope. Construction Procurement valued over $165,000 is excluded. </p>

							<p class="title28">We heard YOU!</p>
							<p class="title20 dark">The platform was created to meet the ongoing request we had from Chief Procurement Officers.</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<p>They wanted an easy-to-use tool to quickly assess their people against strategies and landscapes that seem to change frequently and rapidly. The requirement was that it needed to be:</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<ul class="tick-mark1">
								<li>Contextually relevant to the procurement profession, as it is today – in Australasia.</li>
								<li>Since change often dictates the need for new skills or behaviours – it needs to be modified and regularly updated to conduct iterative assessments</li>
								<li>Easily deployed to geographically dispersed workforces through an online secure interface.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<p>Understanding that different industries and organisations have their own unique set of considerations and complexities, we also ensured that the tool could be tailored for your specific environment.</p>
							<hr class="divider-line" />
							<p class="title28">Why a self-assessment?</p>
							<p class="title20 dark">It offers a systemised and constructive way to think about your skill set and evaluate it.</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<p>In our everyday work we often make evaluations of our knowledge and skills as we perform our tasks. In some areas we will feel confident knowing we are equipped to perform the task. In others we may feel trepidation as we approach a task that we have less familiarity with. Sometimes we may not make an evaluation at all.</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<ol class="list1">
								<li>I am aware that I am competent in this skill/ task</li>
								<li>I am unaware that I am competent in this skill/ task</li>
								<li>I am aware that I am not yet competent in this skill/ task</li>
								<li>I am unaware that I am not yet competent in this skill/ task</li>
							</ol>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<p class="dark">When a self-assessment is complete it turns unaware into aware.</p>

							<p class="title18">Benjamin Shute</p>
							<p>Rated in the top 35 of under 35's in 'Supply Management Magazine' and rated as the UK's rising stars (2005), Ben has held distinguished roles including Head of Sourcing Strategy for Ericsson in the UK and the Head or Procurement Practice for the Chartered Institute of Purchasing &amp; Supply.</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<p>He now heads up Comprara, an Australian organisation uniquely positioned to provide a range of solutions in Procurement Technology, Sourcing, Training and Managed Services.</p>

							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<p class="title18">Paul Rogers</p>
							<p>Paul Rogers is an experienced management consultant. Paul's interest is in personal and organisational development, and he has used the experiences gained in more than thirty years, and in more than thirty countries, to help answer two key questions; what capabilities drive superior performance, and how do we define what level of capability is needed?</p>
							<p>&nbsp;</p>
							<p>Paul has helped design and calibrate the internal 'logic' of the solutions, so that they measure the right dimensions, and so the results are better predictors of actual capability, and ultimately on-the-job performance.</p>
